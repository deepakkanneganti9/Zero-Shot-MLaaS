Understood — here is the corrected, polished README section with **MLaaS** everywhere (not MLS).
I also fixed all headings and references to ensure perfect consistency.

# **MLaaS Data Generator**

The **MLaaS Data Generator** creates synthetic Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) datasets using widely adopted benchmark datasets. It produces service-level attributes, client-level distributions, and composition scenarios for evaluating MLaaS performance, service selection, and zero-shot prediction models.

---

## **1. Overview**

This tool generates structured MLaaS datasets that include:

* Service-level metadata
* Client label distributions
* IID and non-IID data splits
* Historical and manually measured performance
* Predicted performance for new service combinations
* Multi-service composition (1–5 services)

The generator is designed for research in **MLaaS composition**, **federated learning**, and **performance prediction**.

## **2. Datasets Used**

The MLaaS Data Generator uses benchmark datasets provided through **TensorFlow/Keras**.

### **MNIST**

* Handwritten digit classification (10 classes)
* 70,000 samples (60k train / 10k test)
* Source: `tf.keras.datasets.mnist`

### **Fashion-MNIST**

* Clothing image classification (10 classes)
* 70,000 samples (60k train / 10k test)
* Source: `tf.keras.datasets.fashion_mnist`

### **CIFAR-10**

* 32×32 RGB object classification (10 classes)
* 60,000 samples (50k train / 10k test)
* Source: `tf.keras.datasets.cifar10`

These datasets are used to create MLaaS “services” with varying complexity and performance characteristics.

## **3. Data Distribution (IID and Non-IID)**

The generator supports multiple data distribution strategies:

### **IID**

* Uniform and random distribution of samples
* Balanced label proportions across clients
* Suitable for stable MLaaS simulations

### **Non-IID**

* Label-skewed splits
* Quantity-skewed distributions
* Dirichlet-based heterogeneous partitions
* Reflects realistic MLaaS and IoT conditions where data is imbalanced or biased
